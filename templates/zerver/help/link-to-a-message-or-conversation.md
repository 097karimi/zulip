# Link to a message or conversation

Share permanent links to messages, threads, and streams. The Zulip project
uses this feature extensively to link to Zulip conversations from our
issue tracker.

## Link to a stream or topic

{start_tabs}

1. Click on a stream or topic in the left sidebar.

1. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

{end_tabs}

!!! warn ""
    This works for all views, including searches.
    All URLs in Zulip are designed to be shareable.

## Link to a specific message

{start_tabs}

{!message-actions-menu.md!}

1. Click **Copy link to message**.

{end_tabs}

This will copy to your clipboard a permanent link to the message,
displayed in its thread (i.e. topic view for messages in a stream).

Viewing a thread via a message link will never mark messages as read.
